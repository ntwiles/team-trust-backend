# Team Trust Backend

## Installation

Use the package manager `npm` to install.

```bash
npm install
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm start
```

This will transpile to the `/build` directory and execute the resulting JS with Babel to start the web server.

```bash
npm run build
```
This will transpile to the `/build` directory without starting the web server.

```
npm run prettier
```
This will run `prettier` (using `.prettierrc` for config) on every `.ts` file in the `/src` directory.
